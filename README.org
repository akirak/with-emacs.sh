  emacs-sandbox.sh [OPTIONS] [EMACS-ARGS]

  Run Emacs in a "sandbox" user-emacs-directory.  If no directory is

  Options
    --debug     Show debug information and don't remove temp directory.
    -h, --help  This.
    --          Optionally used to separate script arguments from
                Emacs arguments.

    -d, --dir DIR          Use DIR as user-emacs-directory.

    -i, --install PACKAGE      Install PACKAGE.
    -O, --no-org-repo          Don't use the orgmode.org ELPA repo.
    -P, --no-package           Don't initialize the package system.
